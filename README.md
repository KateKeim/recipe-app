# Recipe Application with Python and Django
![Recipe App]()

Welcome to the Recipe Application! This web application is built using Python and Django and is designed to help you manage and discover your favorite recipes. 
Whether you're a cooking enthusiast or just looking for meal ideas, this app has you covered.
## User Goals ##
Users should be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty
parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app. Users should also be able to search for
recipes by their ingredients.

## Key Features ##
* Create and manage the user’s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database.
* Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.
* Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level.
* Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time,
and difficulty of the recipe.

## Technical Requirements ##
* The app should handle any common exceptions or errors that may pop up either during user
input, database access, for example, and display user-friendly error messages.
* The app must connect to a MySQL database hosted locally on your system.
* The app must provide an easy-to-use interface, supported by simple forms of input and concise
instructions that any user can follow—always assume that they aren’t as technically proficient.
* The app should work on Python 3.6+ installations.
* App code must be well-formatted according to standardized guidelines
* App code should also be supported by concise, helpful comments that illustrate the flow of the
program.
* Ideally, the application should be able to handle any kind of input from the user— assume that
your user would enter random, nonsensical inputs (this concept is known as “monkey testing”).
Although monkey testing is formally an automated process, you can try this yourself manually
with your own set of inputs. Test the limits of your application by entering erroneous choices,
random characters, or long strings.
